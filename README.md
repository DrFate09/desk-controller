This keypad controls my entire desk setup. Everything from the LG OLED TV, USB Switch, Monitor Lights, and even the Standing Desk is controlled with this keypad.

You can see a demonstration of the controller on YouTube: [How I Automated my Desk Setup](https://youtu.be/DTJSREjWH7Y)

This setup includes a combination Auto Hotkey, Home Assistant and ESPHome scripts in order to work. Sample code has been included in the respective folders.
