This keypad controls my entire desk setup. Everything from the LG OLED TV, USB Switch, Monitor Lights, and even the Standing Desk is controlled with this keypad.
You can see a demonstration of the controller on YouTube: [How I Automated my Desk Setup](https://youtu.be/DTJSREjWH7Y)

I've included some samples of my project that includes code for Auto Hotkey, Home Assistant and ESPHome.
